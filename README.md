## `medkit/` (Assignment 1 — MedKit Component Library)

A small React + TypeScript component library that can be built and tested as a package.

### Main folders
- `src/`
  - `components/` — UI components (each component has its own folder)
    - `AppointmentCard/`
    - `DataTable/`
    - `MedicationSearch/`
    - `TimeSlotPicker/`
    - `VitalSignsInput/`
  - `index.ts` — library entry point (exports public components/types)
- `dist/` — build output (generated by `npm run build`; not authored by hand)

### Key files (at repo root of `medkit/`)
- `package.json` — scripts (build/test), deps, package metadata
- `tsup.config.ts` — bundling config (ESM/CJS + type generation)
- `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript config
- `vitest.config.ts` / `vitest.setup.ts` — test runner configuration and setup
- `README.md` — how to install, run tests, and build the library

---

## `pr-review/` (Assignment 5 — PR Review)

Write‑up of a code review for the provided pull request.

### What you’ll find
- `CODE_REVIEW.md` — review notes (issues found, recommendations, and rationale)

---

## `system-design-document/` (Assignment 4 — System Design)

System design document for the multi‑clinic appointment scheduling system.

### What you’ll find
- `SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` — the full design document (includes diagrams, tradeoffs, and decisions)

---

## Notes

- Each assignment folder is intended to stand alone (you can open and evaluate them independently).
- For Assignment 1 (`medkit/`), `dist/` is generated — run `npm install` then `npm run build` to recreate it.
